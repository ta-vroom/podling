# 🐣 Podling
podling is a simple Bash script to automate the creation of system users for rootless containers, with optional support for Quadlet container units.

It helps you:

Create non-login system users

Set up proper runtime directories and user namespace mappings

Enable lingering (so user services persist after logout)

Optionally generate and start a basic Quadlet container unit
